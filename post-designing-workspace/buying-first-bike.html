                                Before passing my test, i had some bikes in mind after doing some research and asking my
                                friends who ride. I decided not to get the school bike as i
                                was sick of it and also heard some negative reviews on it as well. I decided i wanted to
                                get a manual bike for sure and for the type of bike, i was
                                going along the lines of a naked street bike. Below is a list of bikes i shortlisted, in
                                order of preference.

                                I ended up getting the bike i wanted the most, the Bajaj Pulsar NS200. It has a 200CC
                                engine, one of the most fuel efficient bike and also looks the
                                most badass! It is one of the biggest 2B bikes available. I'm 184cm and find the bike
                                pretty tall. I can still flat foot it, but its bigger and taller
                                than the CB190R i learnt on. The bike also comes with a 12L fuel tank, is liquid cooled
                                and fuel injected. You can read more about the bike
                                <a href="https://www.bajajauto.com/motor-bikes/pulsar/pulsar-ns200/specifications"
                                    target="_blank">here</a>. It is made in india so the parts are
                                relatively cheap. (Fun fact, the bike is made in the same factory that makes KTM, so
                                they use the same parts.) The bike sounds great, feels great and
                                operates a lot more smoother than the CB190R.

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>
                                The bike was 7 years old with 3 years of COE (Certificate of Entitlement) left, which
                                grants the legal right of the holder to register,
                                own and use a vehicle in Singapore for a period of 10 years. So after 10 years, i'll
                                have to either scrap the bike or renew the COE. I would be upgrading
                                my license to class 2A then class 2, so i will most likely be scrapping it. But i have
                                grown so attached to it now, it will be a difficult decision for sure.
                                So as i was saying, the total cost of the bike at the shop i went to was $3800. It was
                                really cheap for the pulsar. It was in really good condition as well.
                                I couldn't have asked for a better deal.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                But the real butt kicker was my insurance.
                                Since i was 20 years old, my insurance was around $1475. The younger you
                                are, the more you pay for insurance. With some additional costs, the total rounded up to
                                about $5000. But it was still a pretty good deal. I went for the
                                installment/hire purchase plan and am paying around $150 a month with a downpayment of
                                $2500. Let me break the process down so its easier to digest. I will
                                list the steps for purchasing a bike.
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Choose a bike of your liking</li>
                                <li>Find out price of bike alone without COE and Insurance</li>
                                <li>Purchase bike</li>
                                <li>Apply for insurance (i did it at the dealer itself)</li>
                                <li>Transfer of ownership (done on day of collection)</li>
                                <li>Renew road tax(dealer did it for me on day of collection)</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>Once you have a valid insurance and road tax and payment is settled with dealer
                                (downpayment) and signing of all the documents, you can ride your bike
                                home or to wherever you like. <span class="important-note">An important note:</span>
                                Don't forget to check the amount of petrol left before riding off. If its low, pump at a
                                petrol station
                                near the dealer/shop. You can ask the attendents at the petrol station how to pump.
                                That's what i did. The are friendly and will be more than happy to help
                                teach you. Definetly go easy on the first few days. Just stick to the left lane, go at a
                                comfortable speed and progress and you get more confident.

                                I was told to bring the bike in for servicing every 2000 to 2500 km. You can see this by
                                reseting your trip meter on your bike's display or by calculating
                                based on the starting mileage on the odometer and your current mileage. As for what they
                                do for the servicing, they will change the engine oil, spark
                                plug and oil filter which are important parts of your bike that need to be taken care
                                of.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As for maintenance which you must do on your own, there are 2 things you have to do. The
                                first one is taking care of your chain. You should lube it
                                everyweek with chain lube which you can buy from most motorcycle shops. I reccomend
                                Liqui Moly which you can check out
                                <a href="https://products.liqui-moly.com/motorbike-chain-lube-3.html"
                                    target="_blank">Here</a>. Just put your bike on its mainstand (if it comes with one)
                                and spray the chain and you rotate the rear wheel clockwise. You could also put the bike
                                into first gear and let it turn on its own. One round of
                                spraying should be enough. The second thing you have to do for your bike is making sure
                                the tires are pumped every week. I will be going into more
                                detail on this later below under the heading <b>Petrol and tyre pressure</b>.

                            <p>If you wish to park in your HDB carpark like me, you have to apply for season parking.
                                Essentially, you pay for long term parking in your
                                estate carpark for free, but it has to be renewed every month or you could do it for a
                                longer period like 3 months. Season parking for motorcycles
                                is relatively cheap compared to cars. As of this date, i paid $18 for 1 month. If you
                                live with or near your family, you can apply for Family Season
                                Parking and you only pay $7.50, which is half of the normal price.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For parking outside of hdb, you can download the parking.sg app and pay based on your duration and the location. Some places offer free parking. For 
                                shopping malls and such, some offer motorcycle parking but some don't. Check out <a href="https://www.sgbikeparking.com/" target="_blank">this website</a> to see 
                                which places have and don't have motorcycle as well as areas with free parking.

                                The pulsar NS200 is a really fuel efficient bike. At the momement i only ride 4 times a
                                week clocking about 35km a day. A full tank of petrol (12L)
                                has lasted me for about 2 weeks. I paid around $20 for that full tank. So i only have to
                                pay about $40 a month for petrol which is amazing. But when
                                my school starts again, i might have to pay a bit more as i'll be riding everyday.
                            </p>

                                Your tires have to be pumped every week or every 2 weeks as your
                                two wheels are the only points of contact between the bike and the ground. You should
                                check for the reccomended tyre pressure in the owner's manual
                                or on the sticker pasted somewhere on the frame of your bike. You don't want to
                                overinflate or underinfalate your tires as they are both dangerous
                                and things can get nasty so stay safe and keep to within the reccomended amount. <a

                                is a good video on tyre pressure you should check
                                out that goes into more details on the importance of tyre pressure.
