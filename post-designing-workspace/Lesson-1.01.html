                            When the lesson started, we were told to put on our elbow and knee guards (a requirement for
                            lessons 1.01 to 1.03). We were then briefed what we were going to be
                            taught. In front of me were rows of CB190Rs. The bikes looked huge. With the added width
                            from the crash bars (which i learnt the hard way are meant to

                                Before each lesson and before we rode the bike, we had to do a pre ride check to make sure the bike is working and nothing is broken. First, we turn 
                                the key and start the bike. We tap the horn button to make sure the horn is working, the we flip the indicator switches to the left and right to check
                                them. Look at the front indicators then the rear. Both should be working. Then we press the front brake lever and look at the light on the front on the 
                                bike (the schools attach a row of 3 lights that are linked to the front brake, rear brake and the last light turns on if the speed of the bike is over 
                                30km/h). Then cup the rear brake light and see if it is on. Do the same thing for the rear brake. Also, don't forget to look at the display to see if 
                                there is enough fuel in the bike. Once done, switch the bike off.

                                The Cb190R was a pretty big bike and it was heavy as hell. We had to put it on its main stand which parks the bike upright on 2 'feet'. To do so, we put 
                                our left hand on the left handle bar and right hand on the rear rear or crash bar and put one foot on top of the main stand leg, then push down on it with 
                                the help of our bodyweight and at the same time pulling it up with our right hand at the crash bar. Make sure both legs are on the ground on the bike will tip
                                over. To take it off the main stand, we placed the right leg next to the bike and the left leg slighly in front of the right leg for balance. Then you cover the
                                front brake, don't press it or the bike won't come down, and rock the bike back and forth till it shifts forward and lands on the wheel. Then gently apply the front brake.
                                Don't grab or slam the brake, it will fall over. Also keep the handle bars straight while braking.

                                For mounting, you first have to take the bike off the main stand and hold the front brake. Then, you check back on your right to see if anyone or vehicle is coming before
                                you swing your leg over. When you swing your leg over the bike, it is advised to get your right foot onto the rear brake and press it. Then you sit onto the bike. For dismounting,
                                you check back right again, then while holding the front brake, swing your leg back over. Don't rush or you might drop the bike.

                                By far the most important part of this lesson. The clutch temporarily disconnects the engine from the transmission, which means no drive is going 
                                into the rear wheel. At lower speeds and gears, the clutch has to be released with a lot of control. Too fast and the bike will stall. At slow speeds, 
                                you use the clutch to control your speed not the throttle. Just maintain the throttle while releasing and pulling the clutch with very slighly movements
                                (we are talking milimeters) to control the speed of the bike. We first practised moving with just the clutch and no throttle. Before that, lets go over the 
                                biting point/frinction zone. The biting point is the point where the engine and transmission begin to slighly touch. They are 100% touching each other yet,
                                maybe like 2-5%. What you want to do is gradually allow the engine to transmit force to the rear wheel. If you do it too fast(dumping the clutch), the engine 
                                won't have enough force to get the rear wheel moving. Give transmission time to match rotation of rear wheel. You want to gradually transmit the force of the 
                                engine to the rear wheel. Think of it like trying to push a heavy cement block. If you run with all your strength straight at it and try to push, chances are 
                                it won't move. But if you slowly increasing the force against it progressively, it will start moving.  whole power being transmitted suddenly resulting in a jerky start and a probable stall of the engine.
                                This slipping allows the car engine to transfer the necessary torque to the stationary wheel. Thus, if you rapidly release the clutch slowly with manual transmission, the chances are that the car might stop abruptly.
