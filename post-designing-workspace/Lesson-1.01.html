                            I have decided to post a recap on all my lessons for my class 2B which i passed a couple of weeks ago. It was hard but i really enjoyed riding. I have a bike now
                            (Bajaj Pulsar NS200) and i will be making posts on it too. I hope you find all these posts useful while you learn how to ride.

                                into it. If you are not from Singapore, the way the motorcycle license system works is that there are 
                                3 classes. Class 2B permits you to ride motorcycle not exceeding 200CC in engine capacity. Class 2A is between 200 and 400CC. Class 2
                                is anything above 400CC which where the good stuff is at. I like this system as it deters people from taking a big bike as their 
                                first bike.

                                I was worried mainly about balancing and handling the bike.
                                When the lesson started, we were told to put on our elbow and knee guards (a requirement for
                                lessons 1.01 to 1.03). We were then briefed what we were going to be
                                taught. In front of me were rows of CB190Rs. The bikes looked huge. With the added width
                                from the crash bars (which i learnt the hard way are meant to
                                protect the bike and not me).

                                the bike, such as the throttle, front and rear brakes, gear shift lever and clutch.
                                Secondary controls are like the signal indicators, horn and headlights. I shall seperate
                                it into 2 lists so that it is easier to comprehend.

                                Before each lesson and before we rode the bike, we had to do a pre ride check to make
                                sure the bike is working and nothing is broken. First, we turn
                                the key and start the bike. We tap the horn button to make sure the horn is working, the
                                we flip the indicator switches to the left and right to check
                                them. Look at the front indicators then the rear. Both should be working. Then we press
                                the front brake lever and look at the light on the front on the
                                bike (the schools attach a row of 3 lights that are linked to the front brake, rear
                                brake and the last light turns on if the speed of the bike is over
                                30km/h). Then cup the rear brake light and see if it is on. Do the same thing for the
                                rear brake. Also, don't forget to look at the display to see if
                                there is enough fuel in the bike. Once done, switch the bike off.

                                The Cb190R was a pretty big bike and it was heavy as hell. We had to put it on its main
                                stand which parks the bike upright on 2 'feet'. To do so, we put
                                our left hand on the left handle bar and right hand on the rear rear or crash bar and
                                put one foot on top of the main stand leg, then push down on it with
                                the help of our bodyweight and at the same time pulling it up with our right hand at the
                                crash bar. Make sure both legs are on the ground on the bike will tip
                                over. To take it off the main stand, we placed the right leg next to the bike and the
                                left leg slighly in front of the right leg for balance. Then you cover the
                                front brake, don't press it or the bike won't come down, and rock the bike back and
                                forth till it shifts forward and lands on the wheel. Then gently apply the front brake.
                                Don't grab or slam the brake, it will fall over. Also keep the handle bars straight
                                while braking. You also want to keep the bike upright and close to you.

                            <h3>Riding Posture</h3>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>
                                We were thought 7 points of correct riding posture. But first lets quickly go over the benefits of adopting the proper riding posture.
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Greater riding comfort</li>
                                <li>Improve control of the bike - making it easy to reach for the controls</li>
                                <li>Increase stability of the bike</li>
                                <li>Better awareness of changing road and traffic conditions ahead and around you</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Eyes</h4>
                            <p>
                                Lets go over each posture one by one. First, we shall start with the eyes. The most commonly thought idea is look where you want to go. It is fundamental
                                for riding a bike. Even when walking, you always look where you want to go. Try looking down at the floor and walking or even turning. It will be hard and 
                                you might even fall or lose balance. Same goes for a motorcycle. So chin up and look far ahead.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Shoulders</h4>
                            <p>
                                You want to keep your shoulders relaxed and depressed. Not elevated as it makes it harder to control the bike and makes your entire body feel
                                tight and tense, causing you to make jerky and hard inputs.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h4>Elbows</h4>
                            <p>
                                Bend your elbows slighly and keep them relaxed.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Hands</h4>
                            <p>
                                Grip the handles gently, <span class="not-emphasise">not</span> as hard as you can with a death grip.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Buttocks</h4>
                            <p>
                                Keep your butt as close to the tank as possible so that you have a comfortable reach of the handlebars.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Knees</h4>
                            <p>
                                Grip the fuel tank with your knees for stability. Most of the maneuvering of a motorcycle comes from your hips.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Feet</h4>
                            <p>
                                Rest the arches of your feet on the pegs and keep your toes pointed straight so you have good control of the pedals. Cover both pedals with your feet. Don't 
                                tuck them under them.This will help lower your reaction time.
                            </p>

                                    The clutch temporarily disconnects
                                    the engine from the transmission, which means no drive is going
                                    into the rear wheel. The picture above shows the man holding it with 2 fingers, but
                                    for beginners, it is advised that you
                                    hold it with 4 fingers as you may not have the strength in your fingers to operate
                                    the clutch with 2 fingers yet. At lower speeds and gears, the clutch has to be
                                    released with a
                                    lot of control. Too fast and the bike will stall. At slow speeds,
                                    you use the clutch to control your speed not the throttle. Just maintain the
                                    throttle while releasing and pulling the clutch with very slighly movements
                                    (we are talking milimeters) to control the speed of the bike. We first practised
                                    moving with just the clutch and no throttle. Before that, lets go over the
                                    biting point/frinction zone. The biting point is the point where the engine and
                                    transmission begin to slighly touch. They are 100% touching each other yet,
                                    maybe like 2-5%. What you want to do is gradually allow the engine to transmit force
                                    to the rear wheel. If you do it too fast(dumping the clutch), the engine
                                    won't have enough force to get the rear wheel moving. Give the transmission time to
                                    match rotation of the rear wheel. You want to gradually transmit the force of the
                                    engine to the rear wheel. If you release the clutch too fast or dump it, the whole
                                    power is being transmitted suddenly resulting in a jerky start and a probable stall
                                    of the engine.
                                    This gradual loading allows the bike engine to transfer the necessary torque to the
                                    stationary wheel.

                                    For the throttle, what you want to do is hold it gently. I learnt from
                                    first hand experience that if you hold on to it tightly with a death grip, you will
                                    make big and jerky inputs. However, if you hold it gently, you can make minor small
                                    inputs
                                    and your ride won't be so jerky.

                                <h4>Brakes</h4>
                                <p>
                                    For the front brakes, when you want to brake, you gradually apply pressure starting
                                    with a
                                    light touch. Don't grab with with all your strength. The front wheel
                                    won't have enough traction as all the weight is on the rear wheel and the front
                                    wheel will
                                    end up skidding and you will fall. Grab with lightly with like 5-10% force and
                                    slowly
                                    increase
                                    pressure over time (20%, 30%, 40% etc). The rear brake is not used as much as the
                                    front. The
                                    ratio in which you use the brake is 70% front and 30% rear. I am not saying
                                    don't use your rear brake, but instead, use more of your front as compared to the
                                    rear. Same
                                    thing applies to the rear brake, gradually apply force. This is called progressive
                                    brake pressure. At slower speeds, when you are about to stop, using more rear brake
                                    will
                                    help you avoid hard braking which happens when you use too much front brake and the
                                    front
                                    suspension
                                    compresses down hard.
